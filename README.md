This was my dissertation code for the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

It was designed as a portable device for tracking realtime using the Sense-Shield attachment sensors.

I was utilizing both an online connection to Matlib, and saving locally in a SQLite Database and a CSV file which would be capable of later upload.
With this data, the device would signal the long term survivability for the user based on the weather conditions present within the immediate area.
